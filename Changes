Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Toc.

2008-11-28   Freddy Vulto <fvulto@gmail.com>
	Release 1.00

	- Made ToC compliant to XHTML-1.0 STRICT:
	  - attributes are now quoted;
	  - nested ul's are embedded within li's;
	  - anchor name tag is inserted within header tags instead of outside;
	  - the inserted anchor name tag now is empty, i.e. immediately
	    followed by </a>, to make nested anchor errors less likely to occur.
	- Removed FileHandle dependency and added `:raw:utf8' layers when
	  opening files.  This fixes CRLF issues under Windows (thanks to Dan
	  Dascalescu).

2008-11-20   Freddy Vulto <fvulto@gmail.com>
	Release 0.92

	- Fixed tests on Debian.

2001-09-03   Freddy Vulto <fvulto@gmail.com>

	Release 0.91

	- Tested on Cygwin.
	- Used Unix file type for source files.
	- Updated documentation.
	- Prohibited call with undefined parameter to HTML::Parser->parse() from
	  HTML::_tokenTocEndParser->parse() which caused havoc with version 3.25
	  of HTML::Parser.
	- Specified 'HTML::Parser' as module that needs to be available in order
	  to use HTML::Toc.
	- Added protected method HTML::TocGenerator::_setActiveAnchorName().
	  This method replaces the incongruous access of 
	  'HTML::TocUpdator::_doDeleteTokens' by HTML::TocGenerator.
	  HTML::TocUpdator now overrides '_setActiveAnchorName()' to allow
	  the ancestor call to HTML::TocGenerator only when '_doDeleteTokens'
	  equals false.
